The why in Qwirl:
We have an idea for an app which centers around users truly discovering who they and others are. The idea revolves around what we call a Qwirl
What is a Qwirl: a Qwirl is a set of 15 polls (or some arbitrary number we will define) that define what and who a person is. The user creates these questions/polls (or selects them from a question bank). These are the questions that define this person, what they believe, who they are. The questions can be ideological, moral, philosophical, religious, funny, quirky, weird. The poll contains up to 6 different options as possible answers and the user selects one of these as their answer. After the qwirl is complete, other users get to come and answer it. For each poll in the qwirl the that the other users give an answer to, they find out what the owner/creator of the qwirl answered (also what other people who answered that poll had to say - this is just shown as distribution of the answers). When a user has answered all polls they get what we call a wavelength with owner.
What does the wavelength represent: the higher the wavelength between two users it indicates that these users probably think alike, like the same stuff, dislike the same stuff, have similar beliefs etc.
Fastest way to know who "your people are".

We believe that current interactions on social media applications are inefficient. Why are these interactions inefficient: we believe users don't truly discover one another on most other social media applications. If you find out who and what a person is you need to scroll through their feed see their posts to figure this out. Instead what we present as a solution to this problem is a Qwirl.

A qwirl once created can be shared by the user.
Once another user answers a qwirl, they are shown their wavelength with the user. They can share this too (they'll get a shareable link to this too).
User can view all user responses to their qwirl. Clicking on the user will take them to view each question's answer by the user.
The user can view results of these qwirls that people have answered. We don't want to make it very analytical, but still show all the data that is relevant and stats.
